            "Employment of lawyers is projected to grow 10 percent from 2012 to 2022, about as fast as the average for all occupations. Demand for legal work will continue as individuals, businesses, and all levels of government require legal services in many areas.Despite this need for legal services, more price competition over the next decade may lead law firms to rethink their project staffing, to reduce costs to clients. As clients cut back on legal expenses, demand less expensive rates, and scrutinize invoices, work that was previously assigned to lawyers, such as document review, may now be given to paralegals and legal assistants. Some routine legal work may also be outsourced to other lower-cost legal providers located overseas.While law firms will continue to be the largest employers of lawyers, many large corporations are increasing their in-house legal departments to cut costs. For many companies, the high cost of hiring outside counsel lawyers and their support staff makes it more economical to shift work to their in-house legal department. This will lead to an increase in the demand of lawyers in a variety of settings, such as financial and insurance firms, consulting firms, and healthcare providers.Lawyers will continue to be needed in the federal government to prosecute or defend civil cases on behalf of the United States, prosecute criminal cases brought by the federal government, and collect money owed to the federal government. However, budgetary constraints at all levels of government, especially federal, will moderate employment growth.Demand is typically affected by cyclical swings in the economy. During recessions, demand declines for some discretionary legal services, such as planning estates, drafting wills, and handling real estate transactions. Also, corporations are less likely to litigate cases, when declining sales and profits restrict their budgets. Some corporations and law firms may cut staff to contain costs until business improves.Job ProspectsCompetition should continue to be strong, because more students are graduating from law school each year than there are jobs available. Some recent law school graduates who have been unable to find permanent positions are turning to the growing number of temporary staffing firms that place attorneys in short-term jobs. This service allows companies to hire lawyers as-needed and permits beginning lawyers to develop practical skills.Because of the strong competition, a law graduate's willingness to relocate and his or her work experience are becoming more important. However, to be licensed in another state, a lawyer may have to take an additional state bar examination.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChanging employmentbetween 2004 and 2014"

            "TABLE {         font-size: 12px;      }The requirements to become a fully qualified appraiser or assessor of real estate are complex and vary by state and, sometimes, by the value or type of property. Currently, most appraisers of residential real property must have at least an associate's degree to obtain the entry-level state license category. Appraisers of more complex residential and commercial real property must have at least a bachelor's degree to obtain licensure. In some localities, appraisers may qualify with a high school diploma. Employers generally require these candidates to take basic appraisal courses, complete on-the-job training through an apprenticeship, and work enough hours to meet the requirements for appraisal licenses or certificates. Beginning January 1, 2015, all certified appraisers will be required to have a bachelor's degree prior to obtaining their appraisal license.In addition, all assessors must be licensed or certified, but requirements vary by state. Check with your state's licensing board for specific requirements for both assessors and appraisers.EducationAlthough requirements vary by state, appraisers of residential real property usually must have at least an associate's degree, and appraisers of more complex residential or commercial property usually must have at least a bachelor's degree. In practice, however, most have a bachelor's degree.Courses in subjects such as economics, finance, mathematics, computer science, English, and business or real estate law can be useful for prospective appraisers and assessors.For assessors, most states set education and experience requirements that an assessor must meet in order to practice. A few states have no statewide requirements; instead, each locality sets the standards. In some localities, candidates may qualify with a high school diploma.TrainingEmployers generally require candidates to take basic appraisal courses, complete on-the-job training through long-term on-the-job training, and work enough hours to meet the requirements for licenses or certificates.Licenses, Certifications, and RegistrationsFederal law requires that most appraisers performing appraisals in federally related transactions (federally insured banks and financial institutions) have a state license or certification. There is no such federal requirement for assessors, although some states require certification.Real property appraisers usually value one property at a time, while assessors value many at once, but both occupations use similar methods and techniques. As a result, assessors and appraisers tend to take the same courses for certification. In addition to passing a statewide examination, candidates must usually complete a set number of on-the-job hours.The level of certification determines what type of property a person may appraise. The two federally required certifications are: Certified Residential Real Property Appraiser Certified General Real Property AppraiserBeing a Certified Residential Real Property Appraiser is the minimum requirement to appraise a residential property with a loan amount over $250,000 or any other type of property even if the loan amount is less than $250,000. Obtaining this certification requires: Associate's degree or 21 units of continuing education (as of 2015, a bachelor's degree) 200 hours of appraiser-specific classroom training 2,500 hours of work experience over at least 2 yearsBeing a Certified General Real Property Appraiser permits a person to appraise any property of any type and any value. Obtaining this certification requires: Bachelor's degree or 30 units of specific college-level education 300 hours of appraiser-specific classroom training 3,000 hours of work experience over at least 2 yearsMost states offer a third certification: the Licensed Residential Real Property Appraiser. With this certification, appraisers may appraise noncomplex one-to-four unit residences with a value of less than $1,000,000 and complex one-to-four unit residences with a value of less than $250,000. Obtaining this certification requires: 150 qualifying education hours (as of January 2015, 30 semester hours of college-level education) 2,000 hours of on-the-job training over at least 1 yearFor all of these certifications, candidates must:Have 15 hours of classroom instruction on the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal PracticePass an examIn most states, candidates working toward licensure or certification as an appraiser are considered to be trainees. Training programs vary by state, but they usually require candidates to take at least 75 hours of specified appraiser education before applying for a job as a trainee.Unlike appraisers, assessors have no federal requirement for certification. In states that mandate certification for assessors, the requirements are usually similar to those for appraisers. Some states also have more than one level of certification.For example, the International Association of Assessing Officers (IAAO) offers the Certified Assessment Evaluator (CAE). This designation covers topics that include property valuation for tax purposes, property tax administration, and property tax policy. As of January 1, 2014, applicants are required to have a bachelor's degree prior to obtaining the designation.For those states that do not require certification for assessors, the hiring office usually requires the candidate to take basic appraisal courses, complete on-the-job training, and work enough hours to meet the requirements for appraisal licenses or certificates. Many assessors also have a state appraisal license.Assessors tend to start working in an assessor's office that provides on-the-job training; smaller municipalities are often unable to provide this work experience. An alternate source of experience for aspiring assessors is through a revaluation firm.Both appraisers and assessors must take continuing education courses to keep the license or certification. Requirements vary by state.Important QualitiesAnalytical skills. Appraisers and assessors of real estate use many sources of data when valuing a property. As a result, they must carefully research and analyze all data before estimating a value and producing a final written report.Customer-service skills. Because appraisers must regularly interact with clients, being polite and friendly is important. In addition, these characteristics may help expand future business opportunities.Math skills. Accurately analyzing real estate data, such as calculating square footage of land and building space, requires workers to have good math skills.Organizational skills. To successfully accomplish all the tasks related to appraising and assessing a property, appraisers and assessors of real estate need good organizational skills.Problem-solving skills. Appraisers and assessors of real estate may encounter unexpected problems when appraising or assessing a property's value. The ability to develop and apply an alternative solution is crucial to successfully completing the appraisal and report on time.Time-management skills. Appraisers and assessors of real estate often work under time constraints, sometimes appraising many properties in a single day. As a result, managing time and meeting deadlines are important."

Normally, a marketing campaign will also require market research to determine the various product appeal to various demographic groups.One of the key skills a marketing manager must possess is organization. Even small changes or iterations on existing marketing campaigns can require a great deal of coordination and timing precision.

Most marketing managers will be required to have a marketing degree from a university, with management disciplines and postgraduate work favored. Marketing managers typically work regular hours during the work week, but they should expect to put in longer days when launching new campaigns."

Even when plans are completed and approved, the inspector will conduct on-site visits and inspections to make sure the drafts and schematics are followed to the letter. Throughout the construction process, adjustments to schematics and plans must be approved by the inspector, as well.Many building management companies with multiple properties to maintain will also keep a building inspector on payroll to perform periodic preventive checks. These inspections typically involve examining a building for safety and liability issues and issuing cost and safety suggestions for repairs and improvements. Most communities and jurisdictions also require all newly-completed structures to receive a final inspection before being certified for human occupancy, and these public employers will also keep building inspectors on payroll.To work as a building inspector, one is typically required to have a degree in an engineering specialty from an accredited four-year university or college. A building inspector must carry multiple state- and locally-issued certifications which may require continuing education, as local codes are typically subject to changes year by year. Those who work as inspectors must be aware of these changes and keep all certifications and licenses up-to-date. Building inspectors typically work regular business hours, either in an office environment or at building sites."

Often, they communicate with external parties on issues related to the client's care. For example, some clients may be unable to talk on the phone; direct support professionals may help provide solutions for those clients and work with caretakers and loved ones as necessary.",

However, in some cases, direct support professionals may report to a specific building in which several residents need their services.

As most direct support professionals are employed by contractors, many support professionals may need to report their activities to their employer, a care home manager, and/or clients' families. For this reason, direct support professionals must have excellent communications and interpersonal skills. A high school diploma or equivalent is generally required for direct support professionals, as is daily access to a vehicle. Additional qualifications - and previous experience in the field of patient care and disability services - are often preferred."

            "An inside sales representative works for a company that wants to sell a product or service. It is the inside sales representative's job to complete the process of that sale from start to finish. This may be done over the phone or in person via walk-in clients. The sales representative's job may consist of tracking down new sales prospects and maintaining relationships with potential future buyers. An inside sales representative is responsible for being very familiar with the product or service he or she is selling. This may be accomplished by attending training sessions, testing out samples of the product or service, or even purchasing the product in order to use it and become acquainted with it. Inside sales representatives are typically given a sales quota by management. Meeting the quota on a weekly or monthly basis is the goal. The work environment for inside sales reps is usually indoors, either on the company's premises or at an outside location. Hours for sales reps vary depending on the company, but may extend beyond typical business hours to include nights and weekends. Once a sale is made, the sales rep may also be responsible for ensuring that the product or service arrives on time, as well as following up to find out more about customer satisfaction. The education required for an inside sales representative position varies greatly, but sometimes requires as little as a high school diploma or equivalent certificate. Good \"people skills\" are essential, along with good time management skills."

            "TABLE {         font-size: 12px;      }The requirements to become a fully qualified appraiser or assessor of real estate are complex and vary by state and, sometimes, by the value or type of property. Currently, most appraisers of residential real property must have at least an associate's degree to obtain the entry-level state license category. Appraisers of more complex residential and commercial real property must have at least a bachelor's degree to obtain licensure. In some localities, appraisers may qualify with a high school diploma. Employers generally require these candidates to take basic appraisal courses, complete on-the-job training through an apprenticeship, and work enough hours to meet the requirements for appraisal licenses or certificates. Beginning January 1, 2015, all certified appraisers will be required to have a bachelor's degree prior to obtaining their appraisal license.In addition, all assessors must be licensed or certified, but requirements vary by state. Check with your state's licensing board for specific requirements for both assessors and appraisers.EducationAlthough requirements vary by state, appraisers of residential real property usually must have at least an associate's degree, and appraisers of more complex residential or commercial property usually must have at least a bachelor's degree. In practice, however, most have a bachelor's degree.Courses in subjects such as economics, finance, mathematics, computer science, English, and business or real estate law can be useful for prospective appraisers and assessors.For assessors, most states set education and experience requirements that an assessor must meet in order to practice. A few states have no statewide requirements; instead, each locality sets the standards. In some localities, candidates may qualify with a high school diploma.TrainingEmployers generally require candidates to take basic appraisal courses, complete on-the-job training through long-term on-the-job training, and work enough hours to meet the requirements for licenses or certificates.Licenses, Certifications, and RegistrationsFederal law requires that most appraisers performing appraisals in federally related transactions (federally insured banks and financial institutions) have a state license or certification. There is no such federal requirement for assessors, although some states require certification.Real property appraisers usually value one property at a time, while assessors value many at once, but both occupations use similar methods and techniques. As a result, assessors and appraisers tend to take the same courses for certification. In addition to passing a statewide examination, candidates must usually complete a set number of on-the-job hours.The level of certification determines what type of property a person may appraise. The two federally required certifications are: Certified Residential Real Property Appraiser Certified General Real Property AppraiserBeing a Certified Residential Real Property Appraiser is the minimum requirement to appraise a residential property with a loan amount over $250,000 or any other type of property even if the loan amount is less than $250,000. Obtaining this certification requires: Associate's degree or 21 units of continuing education (as of 2015, a bachelor's degree) 200 hours of appraiser-specific classroom training 2,500 hours of work experience over at least 2 yearsBeing a Certified General Real Property Appraiser permits a person to appraise any property of any type and any value. Obtaining this certification requires: Bachelor's degree or 30 units of specific college-level education 300 hours of appraiser-specific classroom training 3,000 hours of work experience over at least 2 yearsMost states offer a third certification: the Licensed Residential Real Property Appraiser. With this certification, appraisers may appraise noncomplex one-to-four unit residences with a value of less than $1,000,000 and complex one-to-four unit residences with a value of less than $250,000. Obtaining this certification requires: 150 qualifying education hours (as of January 2015, 30 semester hours of college-level education) 2,000 hours of on-the-job training over at least 1 yearFor all of these certifications, candidates must:Have 15 hours of classroom instruction on the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal PracticePass an examIn most states, candidates working toward licensure or certification as an appraiser are considered to be trainees. Training programs vary by state, but they usually require candidates to take at least 75 hours of specified appraiser education before applying for a job as a trainee.Unlike appraisers, assessors have no federal requirement for certification. In states that mandate certification for assessors, the requirements are usually similar to those for appraisers. Some states also have more than one level of certification.For example, the International Association of Assessing Officers (IAAO) offers the Certified Assessment Evaluator (CAE). This designation covers topics that include property valuation for tax purposes, property tax administration, and property tax policy. As of January 1, 2014, applicants are required to have a bachelor's degree prior to obtaining the designation.For those states that do not require certification for assessors, the hiring office usually requires the candidate to take basic appraisal courses, complete on-the-job training, and work enough hours to meet the requirements for appraisal licenses or certificates. Many assessors also have a state appraisal license.Assessors tend to start working in an assessor's office that provides on-the-job training; smaller municipalities are often unable to provide this work experience. An alternate source of experience for aspiring assessors is through a revaluation firm.Both appraisers and assessors must take continuing education courses to keep the license or certification. Requirements vary by state.Important QualitiesAnalytical skills. Appraisers and assessors of real estate use many sources of data when valuing a property. As a result, they must carefully research and analyze all data before estimating a value and producing a final written report.Customer-service skills. Because appraisers must regularly interact with clients, being polite and friendly is important. In addition, these characteristics may help expand future business opportunities.Math skills. Accurately analyzing real estate data, such as calculating square footage of land and building space, requires workers to have good math skills.Organizational skills. To successfully accomplish all the tasks related to appraising and assessing a property, appraisers and assessors of real estate need good organizational skills.Problem-solving skills. Appraisers and assessors of real estate may encounter unexpected problems when appraising or assessing a property's value. The ability to develop and apply an alternative solution is crucial to successfully completing the appraisal and report on time.Time-management skills. Appraisers and assessors of real estate often work under time constraints, sometimes appraising many properties in a single day. As a result, managing time and meeting deadlines are important."

Higher positions may require a bachelor's degree or some insurance-related work experience. Auto damage appraisers typically have a postsecondary non-degree award or work experience in identifying and estimating the cost of automotive repair.EducationA high school diploma or equivalent is typically required to work as an entry-level claims adjuster, examiner, or investigator. However, employers sometimes prefer to hire applicants who have a bachelor's degree or some insurance-related work experience or vocational training. Auto damage appraisers typically have a postsecondary non-degree award or experience working in an auto repair shop, identifying and estimating the cost of automotive repair.Different backgrounds or college coursework are best for different types of work in these occupations. For example, a business or an accounting background might be best for someone to specialize in claims of financial loss due to strikes, equipment breakdowns, or merchandise damage. College training in architecture or engineering is helpful for adjusting industrial claims, such as those involving damage from fires or other accidents. A legal background is beneficial to someone handling workers' compensation and product liability cases. A medical background is useful for examiners working on medical and life insurance claims.Although auto damage appraisers are not required to have a college education, most companies prefer to hire people who have formal training, experience, or knowledge and technical skills to identify and estimate the cost of automotive repair. Many vocational schools and some community colleges offer programs in auto body repair and teach students how to estimate the costs to repair damaged vehicles.For investigator jobs, a high school diploma or equivalent is the typical education requirement. Most insurance companies prefer to hire people trained as law enforcement officers, private investigators, claims adjusters, or examiners because these workers have good interviewing and interrogation skills.TrainingAt the beginning of their careers, claims adjusters, examiners, and investigators work on small claims, under the supervision of an experienced worker. As they learn more about claims investigation and settlement, they are assigned larger, more complex claims.Auto damage appraisers typically get on-the-job training, which may last several months. This training usually involves working under supervision of a more experienced appraiser while estimating damage costs until the employer decides the trainee is ready to do estimates on his or her own.Licenses, Certifications, and RegistrationsLicensing requirements for claims adjusters, appraisers, examiners, and investigators vary by state. Some states have few requirements, and others require either completing pre-licensing education, a satisfactory score on a licensing exam, or both.In some states, claims adjusters employed by insurance companies can work under the company license and need not become licensed themselves.Public adjusters may need to meet separate or additional requirements.Some states that require licensing also require a certain number of continuing education credits per year to renew the license. Federal and state laws and court decisions affect how claims must be handled and what insurance policies can and must cover. Examiners working on life and health claims must stay up to date on new medical procedures and prescription drugs. Examiners working on auto claims must be familiar with new car models and repair techniques. Workers can fulfill their continuing education requirements by attending classes or workshops, by writing articles for claims publications, or by giving lectures and presentations.Important QualitiesAnalytical skills. Adjusters and examiners must evaluate whether the insurance company is obligated to pay a claim and determine the amount to pay. Adjusters must carefully consider various pieces of information to reach a decision.Communication skills. Claims adjusters and investigators must get information from a wide range of people, including claimants, witnesses, and medical experts. They must know the right questions to ask in order to gather the information they need.Interpersonal skills. Adjusters, examiners, and investigators often meet with claimants and others who may be upset by the situation that requires a claim or by the settlement the company is offering. These workers must be understanding yet firm with their company's policies.Math skills. Appraisers must be able to calculate property damage."

The analyst is expected to provide information on the company's current financial position and make recommendations to company decision-makers. For instance, the analyst may inform an executive board about whether expansion may be high risk or help the company decide on issuing bonds to cover capital improvements. The analyst may also provide advice and analysis on protecting a company's wealth in the short term during economic downturns.A financial analyst typically has at least a bachelor's degree in finance, business or a related field, although additional education is common.

            "Real estate appraisers are responsible for assessing the value of a property. Most real estate appraisers are contracted by an individual or a business (via an appraisal company) to perform a series of routine checks that will go on record to establish a property's worth. Appraisers' duties vary based on type of property and specific circumstance. For example, assessing the value of a commercial building may take substantially longer than an assessment of a single home. However, appraisers working on personal homes typically deal with multiple jobs at a time.", 
            "When real estate appraisers assess a property, they perform a number of checks to establish flaws and strengths in the property. They check the physical well being of the property and make note of newer installations. All assessments are done in the context of relative property value; for example, if a home is high in value physically but resides in an undesirable neighborhood, appraisers weigh location in their evaluation. Whether real estate appraisers spend a lot of time on-site or in the office depends largely on the size of their current workload. For large appraisals, substantial time may be spent in the appraiser's office, as the physical inspection of a building may not take relatively long. However, if appraisers are working on multiple smaller properties, they may split their time evenly between the field and the office. Appraisers typically work on their own, and overtime is frequently required.An associate's degree is commonly required for this position, as well as state certification. Previous experience in a similar position is frequently preferred."
